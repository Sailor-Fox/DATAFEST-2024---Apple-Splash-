## Video Effectiveness

Videos are not highly effective in driving engagement

```{r video_distractions}
media_views %>%
  drop_na(proportion_video) %>%
  group_by(media_id, book) %>%
  count(page, Engaged = proportion_time > 0.8) %>%
  mutate(media_id = case_when(
    media_id == "379060892" ~ "Ch4 S2 Video 1",

Insights and Recommendations

-   Students are only somewhat engaged
-   Sample size is relatively small due to many NA values
-   We recommend a better data collection process: Check how data is classified (if students don't interact with the video, put 0 instead of NA), add notes if NA on purpose
-   Use checkpoints within each video to drive engagement
